I am a passionate software developer from Georgia with a deep-seated enthusiasm for programming that began in high school. My love for problem-solving drives me to continually expand my skill set and explore innovative solutions. Through effective communication and time management, I have consistently contributed to the success of team projects, and my innate curiosity enables me to tackle complex challenges with creative approaches.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I find joy in music and reading, which enrich my perspective and foster continuous learning. My goal is to leverage my skills in a role that not only enhances my expertise but also prepares me for future leadership opportunities.
